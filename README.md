# NoiseHopper

In this work, we have proposed an improved covert channel to exfiltrate data from air-gapped devices, formed by pulse width modulation (PWM) controlled electromagnetic emission with spectrum covertness rendered by frequency hopping. It is covert not only in the execution domain (malicious code) but also in the RF spectrum (it looks like noise or spurious peaks have been added to the existing RF spectrum), making it difficult to detect. Our proposed channel can penetrate through a wall and we have transmitted MNIST dataset images (at a 10 kbps rate) using the covert channel to show its efficacy.

# FastPwmPin Library

We have used this Arduino library to generate a fast PWM signal on pin 10 of Arduino UNO. You need to download this library and keep in your project folder to run our code successfully.
